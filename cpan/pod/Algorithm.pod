Marpa::R2::Algorithm - The Earley algorithm

=head1 Description

For most purposes, the user does not need to know anything
about the Earley algorithm or Marpa algorithm,
and can ignore this document.
This document describes those aspects of the Earley 
and Marpa
algorithms which 
are relevant in certain cases,
when using Marpa.
These cases include
L<tracing and
debugging|Marpa::R2::Progress.pod>
and
L<use of the recognizer's ranking
methods|Marpa::R2::Rank.pod>.
A reader of this document should
be familiar with the basic parsing terminology
described in L<Marpa::R2::Vocabulary.pod>.

=head1 Dotted rules

Marpa is based on Jay Earley's algorithm for parsing.
The idea behind Earley's algorithm is that you can
parse by building a table of rules
and where you are in those rules.
"Where" means two things: location in the rule relative to the rule's
symbols,
and location relative to the parse's input stream.

Let's look at an example of a rule in a context-free grammar.
Here's the rule for assignment from the Perl distribution's C<perly.y>

S<C<E<nbsp>E<nbsp>E<nbsp>E<nbsp>termbinop -E<gt> term ASSIGNOP term>>

C<ASSIGNOP> is C<perly.y>'s internal name for
the assignment operator.
In plain Perl terms, this is the "C<=>" character.

In parsing this rule, we can be at any of four possible locations.
One location is at the beginning, before all of the symbols.
The other three locations are immediately after each of the rule's
three symbols.

Within a rule, position relative to the symbols of the rule
is traditionally indicated with a dot.  In fact, the symbol-relative
rule position is very often called the B<dot location>.  Taken as
a pair, a rule and a dot location are called a B<dotted rule>.

Here's our rule with a dot location indicated:

S<C<E<nbsp>E<nbsp>E<nbsp>E<nbsp>termbinop -E<gt> . term ASSIGNOP term>>

The dot location in this dotted rule is at the beginning.
A dot location at the beginning of a dotted rule means
that we have not recognized any symbols in the rule yet.
All we are doing is predicting that the rule will occur.
A dotted rule with the dot before all of its symbols is called a B<prediction>
or a B<predicted rule>.

Here's another dotted rule:

S<C<E<nbsp>E<nbsp>E<nbsp>E<nbsp>termbinop -E<gt> term . ASSIGNOP term>>

In this dotted rule,
we are saying we have seen a C<term>, but have not yet recognized
an C<ASSIGNOP>.

There's another special kind of dotted rule, a completion.
A B<completion> (also called a B<completed rule>)
is a dotted rule with the dot after all of the symbols.
Here is the completion for the rule that we have been using as an example:

S<C<E<nbsp>E<nbsp>E<nbsp>E<nbsp>termbinop -E<gt> term ASSIGNOP term .>>

A completion indicates that a rule has been fully recognized.

=head1 Earley items

The dotted rules contain
all but one piece of the information
that Marpa
needs to track.
The missing piece is the second of the two "wheres": where in the input stream.
To associate input stream location and dotted rules, Marpa uses what are now called Earley items.

A convenient way to think of an B<Earley item> is as a triple, or 3-tuple,
consisting of dotted rule, origin and current location.
The B<origin> is the location in the input stream where the dotted rule starts.
The B<current location> (also called the B<dot location>)
is the location in the input stream which corresponds to the
dot position.

In Marpa terms,
G1 location is location in terms of the G1 subgrammar's Earley sets.
When the term "location" is used in this document, it means G1 location unless
otherwise indicated.

A user often finds it much more convenient to think in terms of line and column position in
the input stream, instead of G1 location.
Every G1 location corresponds to a range of positions in the input stream.
When the term "position" is used in this document, it means input stream position,
unless otherwise indicated.

Two noteworthy consequences
follow from the way in which origin and current G1 location are defined.
First,
if a dotted rule is a prediction,
then origin and current location will always be the same.
Second,
the input stream location where a rule ends is not tracked unless the
dotted rule is a completion.
If its dotted rule is not a completion,
an Earley item does not tell us
if a rule will
ever be completed,
much less at which location.
